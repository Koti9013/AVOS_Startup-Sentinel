# AVOS(Antivirus Optimizer Software): Startup Sentinel
This simple project can scan your task manager &amp; startup files, can find intruders and report them to you. It is also open source, so it guarantees you that it will not harm your computer.
 # How to use
To use this version you need to:
***First,*** download the `.zip` file. Extract the files inside to an *empty* folder.
1. Run the "Launcher" file. It will automatically start the script.
2. Wait until the antivirus start scanning. It will automatically check for new updates and download it.
3. Then the antivirus will notify you if there's something potentially dangerous. Don't worry, it'll scan only startup tasks and check their path. If their "home" is a folder for short-timed files, then it might be a virus.
4. For now, it's up to you. Check the file's path and think before typing the 'y' key. It will delete the file and continue scanning. If you don't want to delete it, just type 'n' key.
